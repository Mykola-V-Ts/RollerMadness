# Roller Madness

This project was created as a submission for one of the assignments in the [online game development course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/game-design-and-development). The goal of the assignment was to design a game where the player controlls a ball, collects coins and avoids cube-shaped enemies. I completed the project within a two-day timeframe, adding my own personal touch to emulate the look and feel of *Dark Souls* games.

### Dark Souls Inspiration

I wanted to make gameplay deeper and put myself up to the challenge. So I decided to reinterpret the assignment in the style of *Dark Souls* series, which led to the following changes:

* **Combat:** Enemy cubes also damage each other, allowing you to defeat them by leading them into one another.
* **Boss fights:** Each level culminates in a battle against a larger, more powerful cube with more health and slower movement.
* **Visuals:**
    * **Post-processing effects** designed to emulate look of *Dark Souls 2*.
    * **UI** elements are taken from *Dark Souls 1*.
    * **Design** of the first level is a reference to the first boss in *Dark Souls 1*.
* **Music** and **sound effects** taken from *Dark Souls 1*.
